The system successfully transcribed the provided audio using the Whisper model and produced a medium confidence score (0.65). The original transcript correctly captured most of the spoken text, though there was a small recognition error where the word “speech” was transcribed as “speak.” This highlights a common limitation of speech-to-text models: minor phonetic inaccuracies, especially in shorter or context-free clips.

The redacted transcript correctly replaced personal information (name) with <PERSON>, demonstrating effective privacy handling. Since the text was short, the summarization component returned “Text is too short to summarize”, which is an appropriate response for this input length.

Overall, the application correctly integrated AI components — Speech-to-Text, PII Redaction, Confidence Scoring, and Text-to-Speech Output — in a single automated workflow, meeting the technical and ethical objectives of the assignment.
